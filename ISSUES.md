# Known Issues

## Active Bugs

- **Docker tag aliasing behavior**
    - Location: docker_challenges/functions/general.py (get_repositories)
    - Issue: Plugin reads first tag in image RepoTags array
    - Impact: Images with multiple tags may not appear correctly in repository dropdown
    - Workaround: Remove unwanted tags, leaving only desired tag as primary
    - Effort: TBD (requires Docker API research)

## ℹ️ Suggestions / Technical Debt

### Architecture

- **Inconsistent frontend technology stack**
    - Issue: jQuery + Alpine.js + vanilla JS hybrid across files
    - Impact: Confusing for contributors, larger bundle size
    - Fix: Commit fully to Alpine.js (aligns with CTFd 3.8.0+ core theme)
    - Effort: 6 hours

## Feature Requests

- Create secrets from CTFd into docker
- Autocreate connection info based on service type
- Dynamic port pointing (avoid hardcoded port ranges)
- Individual secret permissions (per-secret permission control)
- Mark flags as secret (autocreate secrets from flag values)
- WebSocket/Server-Sent Events for real-time status updates (replace polling entirely for better scalability)
- TypeScript migration for type safety
- Database indexes for performance (team_id+challenge_id, timestamp)
